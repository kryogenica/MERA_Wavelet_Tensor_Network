# MERA Wavelet Tensor Network


This Colab notebook intends to convert into Python coding the following paper ["Representation and design of wavelets using unitary circuits"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07312.pdf) into Python code.
It will encode into a a pyramidal tensor network the scaling & wavelet sequences.
{This notebook is currently under construction.}
