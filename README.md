# MERA_Wavelet_Tensor_Network


This Colab notebook intends to convert into Python coding the following paper "Representation and design of wavelets using unitary circuits" into Python code.
It will encode into a a pyramidal tensor network the scaling & wavelet sequences.
[This notebook is currently under construction.]
